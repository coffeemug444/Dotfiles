# Ben's Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. It's a setup for:
 - kitty
 - zsh
   - plus some handy scripts
 - neovim
 - a couple of c++ templates for rapid testing


# Usage
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed: `kitty nvim fd ripgrep clangd yazi`

Then continue with the following:
1. Clone this repo to ~/.dotfiles
2. `cd` into it and run `./linkup`
    - ⚠️ Warning: This is a destructive install. All current configurations will be lost, make sure you make a backup.
3. Enjoy my perfect terminal setup
